Code splitting tool for Fine-grained Fault Tolerance
=====================================================

Fine-Grained
Fault Tolerance (FGFT) isolates driver code at the granularity of a
single entry point. It executes driver code as a transaction, allowing roll back if the driver fails. 


This piece of code takes a driver and splits it to produce two kernel modules.
